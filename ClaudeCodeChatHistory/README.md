## Project Summary

**Objective**: Create an Unreal Engine 5.6 tool for processing sprite sheets into 2.5D characters with animations and input handling.

**Evolution**: The project evolved from an initial GUI-based editor tool request to a final console command-driven system for better automation and workflow integration.

## Key Deliverables

1. **2.5D Character System** - Complete character class with XY-constrained movement, camera setup, and animation handling
2. **Sprite Sheet Processing** - Automated import and Paper2D configuration for 8x6 sprite grids  
3. **Enhanced Input Integration** - WASD movement and mouse attack controls
4. **Console Command API** - Four commands for complete workflow automation
5. **Custom Logging** - Project-specific log categories for easy debugging
6. **Comprehensive Documentation** - Usage guides and workflow instructions

## Technical Architecture

- **Runtime Module** (CharacterCreationCpp): Character classes, input handling, core gameplay
- **Editor Module** (CharacterCreationEditor): Console commands, asset generation, editor integration
- **Asset Pipeline**: Automated texture import → sprite extraction → flipbook creation → character assignment
- **Input System**: Enhanced Input Actions and Mapping Context with proper WASD + mouse bindings

## Final Status

✅ **Build Status**: Successful compilation  
✅ **Functionality**: All core features implemented and tested  
✅ **Documentation**: Complete user guides and technical documentation  
✅ **Logging**: Custom categories implemented for easy debugging
